Social Links
==============

* [Blogger](http://timkellogg.blogspot.com) - the original source of my blog. The blog content that appears on this site is pulled via the [gdata api](http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/)
* [Github](https://github.com/tkellogg) - where I participate in open source software development and architecture. If there were one link that I think best represents me, this would be it.
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/503826/kelloti) - There was a time were I was active. Since then I decided it was more useful to develop open source software than to just talk about it
* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/timothy.kellogg) - I find it harder and harder to keep up with facebook. But alas, I do occasionally post.
* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-kellogg/13/29/698) - Probably last on my list of social networking interests. Just too impractical to keep up to date with.
