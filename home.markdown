A Heavy Web Site
---------------

I created this website partially to aggregate all the information about myself (personal website) but also as a challenge and a chance to learn about client side technologies. As such, there is no server-side code. Dynamic data like my blog posts are pulled in from external sources as JSON. Everything else is either hand-written or generated from rake files (i.e. this text is generated from a markdown parser)
