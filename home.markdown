Welcome
---------------

This is my personal web site intended to aggregate sources of social media that I generate. I have enjoyed keeping a technical blog at [blogspot](http://timkellogg.blogspot.com) where I talk about abstract concepts that aren't so much practical as they are analytical. I also enjoy other challenges like climbing [Colorado 14er's](http://www.14ers.com). I've started getting quite a collection of decent pictures of the higher altitudes (another one of my future goals is to post pictures here, I just want to find somewhere other than github to host the actual pictures).

A Heavy Web Site
---------------

This website itself is a little bit of a pet project. I'm using github pages to generate a static website - there is no server side code here. With that said, I am using quite a bit of JavaScript.

One of my recent interests has been showing that JavaScript is going to dominate the landscape of software development. This website is sort of my sandbox to try out some cutting edge JavaScript, like [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

If you're an observant web surfer you might notice that as you navigate my site you never actually leave the page you started on. This is called a single page app, made possible by Backbone's routing capabilities.
