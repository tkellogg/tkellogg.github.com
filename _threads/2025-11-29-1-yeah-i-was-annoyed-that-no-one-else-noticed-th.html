Social media tends to frame Al debate into two caricatures:
(A) Skeptics who think LLMs are doomed and Al is a bunch of hype.
(B) Fanatics who think we have all the ingredients and superintelligence is imminent.
But if you read what leading researchers actually say (beyond the headlines), there's a surprising amount of convergence:
1) The current paradigm is likely sufficient for massive economic and societal impact, even without further research breakthroughs.
2) More research breakthroughs are probably needed to achieve AGI/ASI. (Continual learning and sample efficiency are two examples that researchers commonly point to.)" class="post-image" loading="lazy">

None of them are saying ASI is a fantasy, or that it's probably 100+ years away.
A lot of the disagreement is in what those breakthroughs will be and how quickly they will come. But all things considered, people in the field agree on a lot more than they disagree on.
