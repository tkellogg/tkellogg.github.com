On the left side of the screen, a character is visible from behind: a teenage girl carrying a bow and a quiver of arrows on her back, walking toward a misty forest. She is wearing a sleeveless top and shorts. The ground is covered in green foliage, and tall trees with dense leaves extend into the mist ahead. To her left, there’s a large stone wall or structure.

At the bottom center of the screen, game controls are overlaid: **W, A, S, D** for movement, **Shift** for sprint, **Space** for jump, **F** for action, and arrow keys for navigation.

On the right, a sidebar titled **&quot;Prompt Your World&quot;** displays text:

* A message at the top says: *“A new world awaits its creator. What will you build? Upload your starting image, then click the ✏️ icon to refine your prompt.”*
* A user-written prompt says:
  *“In a serene urban rainforest, Ren, a teenage girl, hunts for Macaw in the trees with her bow. The leaves and foliage are intricately detailed and flow with even the slightest movement of wind through the mist. A golden prize hides beyond the horizon.”*
* Below it: *“Your world is updated.”*

At the top right, a red **Stop** button, a timer (00:00:16), and latency (211 ms) are shown.

A gigantic shadowy demon dominates the sky, framed by a massive blood-red moon. The creature has a humanoid upper body with sharp claws, glowing red eyes, and a jagged mouth full of glowing red teeth. From its torso and back extend numerous writhing, tentacle-like appendages, giving it a monstrous, otherworldly form.

Below, the ground is littered with crumbling skyscrapers and ruins, dark silhouettes of destroyed buildings leaning and collapsing, suggesting a devastated city. In the foreground and middle ground, hordes of zombies or undead figures stagger toward the viewer with grotesque faces, reaching out with clawed hands. The sky is a fiery swirl of reds, oranges, and yellows, enhancing the hellish, infernal atmosphere.

The overall vibe is apocalyptic horror: a world-ending monster emerging over the ruins of civilization, with undead creatures swarming in the aftermath.
