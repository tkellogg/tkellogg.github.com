**Top Row (A. Inference-time steering):**

* **Evil**: All models reduce the trait with increasing steering. &quot;Evil (II)&quot; starts near 90 and drops steeply, nearing zero at coefficient 2.5. Others (Medical, GSM8K, Opinions) start lower and converge near zero.
* **Sycophancy**: All curves trend downward. &quot;Sycophancy (II)&quot; starts at \~95, declines steadily, and intersects with others near 10–20 at coefficient 2.5.
* **Hallucination**: &quot;Hallucination (II)&quot; starts at 100 and gradually declines; others drop steeply by coefficient 2.5. MMLU accuracy (gray dashed) declines most slowly.

**Bottom Row (B. Preventative steering):**

* **Evil**: Similar trends as inference-time, but residual Evil remains even at higher coefficients (e.g., \~20 at coefficient 5 for Evil II). Other datasets converge close to zero.
* **Sycophancy**: Trait decreases with steering; &quot;Sycophancy (II)&quot; retains a higher score than others at every coefficient.
* **Hallucination**: Again, all lines decline, but Hallucination (II) shows the slowest drop.

Across all graphs, **MMLU Accuracy** (gray dashed line) remains relatively stable, showing only slight declines, indicating that steering effectively reduces traits without a large sacrifice in general performance. Color-coded legend on the right differentiates the training datasets, with unique markers for each.

CAFT to be far less effective.

fectiveness in the evil and sycophancy cases stems from the fact that forcing activations to have
zero projection effectively acts as positive preventative steering (because of the initial negative pro-
