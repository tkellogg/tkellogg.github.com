	•	Agents > Workflows: Agents build their own context + decide what to do with tools.
	•	Code Generation for non-coding: We use code gen to generate docs, query the web, etc.

Bash is what makes Claude Code so good.

Bash is a generic version for ‘code mode’ or programmatic tool calling.

– Store the results of tool calls to files, so you can search them.
– Store memory in files.
– Dynamically generate scripts and call them.
– Compose functionality, use unix primitives like tail, grep, cat, etc.
– Use existing powerful software like ffmpeg, libreoffice, etc.”
