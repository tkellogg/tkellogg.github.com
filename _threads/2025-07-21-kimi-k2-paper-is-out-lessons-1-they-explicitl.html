Two types of models are compared:
	•	Solid lines with square markers: models where the number of attention heads equals the number of layers.
	•	Dotted lines with circle markers: counterparts with doubled attention heads.

Each color represents a different total FLOPs budget:
	•	Blue: 1.2e+20 FLOPs
	•	Purple: 2.2e+20 FLOPs
	•	Green: 4.5e+20 FLOPs
	•	Orange: 5.4e+20 FLOPs
	•	Red: 9.0e+20 FLOPs

Across all compute budgets, models with doubled attention heads consistently achieve lower validation loss, reducing it by approximately 0.5% to 1.2%. This advantage is visually shown by the dotted lines dipping below the corresponding solid lines of the same color." class="post-image" loading="lazy">

**Top section (Figure 8: Data synthesis pipeline for tool use)**

* *(a) Synthesizing tool specs, agents and tasks*:

  * Begins with &quot;MCP tools&quot; and &quot;Applications&quot; feeding into a “Tool Repository” that stores both “real-world tool specs” and “synthesized tool specs.”
  * “Domains” also feed into this repository.
  * This flows into “Agents,” which are used to generate “Tasks with rubrics.”

* *(b) Generating agent trajectories*:

  * A “User Agent” interacts with an “Agent,” which observes and calls a “Tool Simulator.”
  * This produces “trajectories” that go to a “Judge Agent” for filtering based on rubrics and tasks, producing “Filtered Data.”

**Bottom section (Figure 9: t-SNE visualizations of tool embeddings)**

* *(a)* Left: A t-SNE scatterplot showing real MCP tools, colored by their original source categories. Clusters appear organic and mixed in structure, with categories like “databases,” “cloud,” and “nlp.”

* *(b)* Right: A t-SNE scatterplot showing synthetic tools, colored by pre-defined domain categories. Clusters are more compact and structured, suggesting deliberate coverage of functional areas like “enterprise,” “science,” and “security.”

Together, these diagrams describe a system that synthesizes tool specs and uses agents to explore them, producing diverse trajectories. The embeddings visualization confirms good category coverage by both real and synthetic tools.

<div class="quote-text">Moonshot have released the Kimi K2 technical report, here are some parts of it I found interesting: <br><br>The best data was used in multiple epochs, but was rephrased between them.
