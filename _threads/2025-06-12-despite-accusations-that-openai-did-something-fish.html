After the o3 price reduction, we retested the 03-2025-04-16 model on ARC-AGI to determine whether its performance had changed.
We compared the retest results with the original results and observed no difference in performance.

<div class="quote-text">occam's razor explanation of OpenAI dropping o3 price by 80% was they were sitting on a fat margin and wanted to test out demand. They changed nothing w model, upgraded their inference code a bit, and made less profit. No nonsense at all they don't have time for that.</div>
