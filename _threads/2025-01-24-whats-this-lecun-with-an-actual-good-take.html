To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think:
“China is surpassing the US in AI.”
You are reading this wrong.

The correct reading is:
“Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.”

DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g., PyTorch and Llama from Meta).
They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work.

Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it.
That is the power of open research and open source.
