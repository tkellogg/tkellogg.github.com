4. Tool design and selection are critical. Agent-tool interfaces are as critical as human-computer interfaces. Using the right tool is efficient-often, it's strictly necessary. For instance, an agent searching the web for context that only exists in Slack is doomed from the start. With MCP servers that give the model access to external tools, this problem compounds, as agents encounter unseen tools with descriptions of wildly varying quality. We gave our agents explicit heuristics: for example, examine all available tools first, match tool usage to user intent, search the web for broad external exploration, or prefer specialized tools over generic ones. Bad tool descriptions can send agents down completely wrong paths, so each tool needs a distinct purpose and a clear description." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
