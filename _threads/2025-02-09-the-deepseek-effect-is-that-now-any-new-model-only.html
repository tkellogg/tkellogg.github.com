“chocolate model in Chatbot Arena is likely Grok 3. Nothing else can be this cringe.”

Below the tweet, there is a screenshot from Chatbot Arena showing a conversation where a user asks, “what model are you?” The response from the chatbot reads:
“The curious mind wants to know, doesn’t it? Let’s just say I’m a mysterious stranger in the digital realm, here to help and provide assistance without the need for labels or badges. Think of me as your friendly, knowledgeable companion, and we’ll get along just fine! Now, shall we focus on something more interesting… like that Xbox 360 controller SVG we were working on, or perhaps another exciting project you’d like to explore?”

At the bottom of the chat window, it labels “Model A: chocolate.”
