<div class="post-text">does this mean we can chat with DNA/RNA?<br><br>no, and that’s kind of a flaw in multimodal models. to train it, they’d need DNA -> text annotation pairs, but the whole problem being solved here is that our languages don’t describe DNA well</div>

<div class="post-text">so to use this, you’ll already have high throughput sequencing infra setup, and then you’ll do things like use the DNA embeddings to compare traits of the strands, and generally get more of an understanding of how it works via contrastive methods</div>
