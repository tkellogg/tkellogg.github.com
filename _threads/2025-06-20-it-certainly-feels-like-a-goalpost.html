Heard this quote at a dinner recently:
•••
&quot;I used to think Claude Code was too expensive compared to other dev tools. But after Opus 4, l realized it's actually very affordable compared to what you'd pay a junior software engineer.&quot;
It feels important to note that we're nearing a price inflection point for Al products where they become good enough that we stop comparing their price to traditional saas products and start comparing them to the cost of human expertise. This will start with code but soon expand into other domains too." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
