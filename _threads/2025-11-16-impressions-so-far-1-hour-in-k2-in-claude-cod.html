<div class="post-text">oh, i just noticed that K2 doesn't really use the TODOs much<br><br>i gave it a huge job and it only created 2 TODO items. basically "1. read stuff, 2. check that it's done"<br><br>i'm not sure it's needed. K2 seems to march happily toward the goal without TODOs</div>

<div class="post-text">yeah, K2-Thinking is not the top coding model, but it's dealing with Rust just fine. Long horizon tasks, adjusting without doom loops, idk i think it's time to call it:<br><br>Rust is not a problem</div>
