Title: “GPT-5.1 spends less time on easy tasks, and more time on hard tasks”

At the top are two legend dots:
	•	Light pink: GPT-5 (Standard)
	•	Bright pink: GPT-5.1 (Standard)

Below is a horizontal bar chart showing # of model-generated tokens per response across percentiles of task difficulty:
	•	10th percentile: GPT-5 bar is small; GPT-5.1 bar is much smaller, labeled –57%
	•	30th percentile: GPT-5 bar medium; GPT-5.1 bar shorter, labeled –31%
	•	50th percentile: two nearly equal bars, labeled –0%
	•	70th percentile: GPT-5.1 bar taller than GPT-5, labeled +21%
	•	90th percentile: GPT-5.1 bar much taller, labeled +71%

At the bottom is explanatory text:

“GPT-5.1 Thinking varies its thinking time more dynamically than GPT-5 Thinking. On a representative distribution of ChatGPT tasks, GPT-5.1 Thinking is roughly twice as fast on the fastest tasks and twice as slow on the slowest tasks. Thinking time was set to Standard for both models.”" class="post-image" loading="lazy">
