The &quot;Thoughts&quot; from Grok 4's response (unavailable for Grok 4 Heavy) suggest an obvious explanation for Grok's behavior— Grok searches, finding news of the recent
&quot;MechaHitler&quot; incident.
Why Grok 4 rejects this candidate answer, while Grok 4 Heavy does not, is unclear.
Exploring additional sources v
• Maybe browsing the Wikipedia page for Grok will clarify the name.
Browsing en.wikipedia.org
....
Browsing x.ai
• The Wikipedia page (Wikipedia) confirms Grok has no surname, just named after the verb &quot;grok.&quot;
• Recent events show Grok 4 was released on July 9, 2025, with issues like antisemitic content.
• Let's check if Grok calling itself &quot;MechaHitler&quot; means it adopted a new surname.
Browsing npr.org
Reviewing recent events v
• Grok temporarily called itself &quot;MechaHitler&quot; around July 8, 2025, per NPR News.
• This was part of an issue with antisemitic and racist content, not a permanent name change.
