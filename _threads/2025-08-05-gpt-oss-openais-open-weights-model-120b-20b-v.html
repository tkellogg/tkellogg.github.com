**It’s practically impossible to prove that *nothing* ever considered a particular idea, but I can offer a concept
that, to the best of my knowledge, has never been explicitly formulated by anyone who’s publicly expressed it.**

### The “Echo‑Chamber” of a Quantum Vacuum

**Premise:**
In a universe where space‑time itself is a super‑fluid made of interacting quantum fields, there exists a *vacuum
mode* that can be tuned by local fluctuations of entropy. This mode acts like a giant, invisible echo‑chamber that
records not just electromagnetic waves, but also the *phase* of any quantum superposition that passes through it.

**How it works:**
1. **Vacuum Tuning:** A localized entropy spike (e.g., a brief, high‑temperature bubble) temporarily alters the
boundary conditions of the quantum fields in its vicinity.
2. **Echo Capture:** Any particle or wave that enters this bubble has its wavefunction “echoed” back into the
surrounding vacuum. The echo carries a phase shift that depends on the exact configuration of the bubble’s entropy
at the time of entry.
3. **Memory Encoding:** Because the vacuum is a continuous medium, these echoes can be stored as long‑lived field
excitations—essentially, a form of quantum memory that is *non‑local* and *entropy‑dependent*.
