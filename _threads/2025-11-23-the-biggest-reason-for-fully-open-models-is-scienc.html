The diagram proceeds left to right in five labeled steps.

⸻

1. THE TASK (REASONING)

A friendly robot chef stands in a kitchen, holding up a perfectly baked soufflé. A math bubble shows x + 2y = 10 as an analogy for solving a problem.
Caption: AI Chef (LLM) solves a problem (bakes a soufflé).

⸻

2. THE “FINGERPRINT” (GRADIENT)

Close-up of the robot whisking batter. A glowing network of abstract swirls appears over the bowl.
Caption: We record the exact, unique actions & “effort” (Gradient) used for this specific soufflé.

⸻

3. THE “BRAIN MAP” (EK/FAC)

The robot stands before floating diagram bubbles labeled Whisking Techniques, Aeration Physics, Heat Transfer, Simplified Linkages.
Caption: We use a simplified map of how the chef connects concepts (Hessian/EK-FAC approximation).

⸻

4. THE LIBRARY MATCH (ATTRIBUTION)

The robot enters a vast library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. A giant glowing fingerprint projection shines onto one shelf as the robot scans for the best match.
Caption: We scan the entire “cookbook library” (pre-training data) to find which book’s instructions best match the fingerprint via the brain map.

⸻

5. THE RESULT: PROCEDURAL KNOWLEDGE

The robot chef proudly holds a glowing lightbulb while a book opens nearby with a concept diagram. A large reference book beside him is titled “THE PHYSICS OF FOAMS & AERATION (NOT a Soufflé Recipe Book!)”
Caption: We find the source was NOT a recipe, but a foundational PRINCIPLE (procedural knowledge) applied to a new task.

⸻

Overall, the image uses the story of baking a soufflé to explain how AI models trace reasoning: capturing gradients, mapping conceptual relations, searching training data, and revealing underlying procedural knowledge rather than direct memorization." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
