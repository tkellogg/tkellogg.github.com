&quot;The thing that happened with AGI and pretraining is that in some sense they overshot the target.
You will realize that a human being is not an AGI.
Because a human being lacks a huge amount of knowledge. Instead, we rely on continual learning.
If I produce a super intelligent 15-year-old, they don't know very much at all. A great student, very eager. [You can say,] 'You go and be a programmer. You go and be a doctor. Go and learn.'
So you could imagine that the deployment itself will involve some kind of a learning trial and error period. It's a process as opposed to, you drop the finished thing.&quot;
