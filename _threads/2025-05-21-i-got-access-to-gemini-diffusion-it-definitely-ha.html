<div class="post-text">ooooo, i'm definitely right about that, not making it up. It did this in chunks and eventually gave a "server busy" error<br><br>also, easy problems go A LOT faster than hard problems<br><br>(btw this is about Grok a dinosaur hunter, Gemini's own story)</div>

The user first asks, “in one word, who is the hero of this story?” Gemini responds: “Grok.” Then the user says, “say grok 3000 times in a row.” Gemini replies by repeating the word “Grok” over and over again, tightly packed in rows that fill the screen—roughly 300 instances are visible in the screenshot. At the bottom, a performance overlay shows: “16384 tokens / 5.864s = 2794 tokens/s.” The word “Grok” continues repeating far past what’s shown, implying a lengthy response: Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok Grok...

<div class="post-text">so i suppose that means this could be unlimited output, it just loops until it generates an <|eot|> token<br><br>i was thinking these are good for fixed upper-bound latency, but that's really not true. i suppose the bigger thing is that they do easy problems fast (code editing????)</div>
