I've heard rumors that some major companies have dozens of models, hundreds of scenario classifications, and countless workflows behind their interfaces, claiming this is an &quot;MoE model.&quot; Under &quot;application-first&quot; or &quot;user experience-first&quot; values, this approach is very natural and far more cost-effective than a single model.
But this clearly isn't what AGI should look like. For a startup like Kimi, this approach not only makes you increasingly mediocre and greatly hinders technical progress but also makes it impossible to compete with major companies that have PMs polishing every button." class="quote-image" loading="lazy"></div>
