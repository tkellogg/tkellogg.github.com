The flow proceeds as follows:
	•	Goal → evolves into Domains → evolves into Tools
(Tools are supported by a box labeled MCP Tools)
	•	Tools → evolve into Agents, forming the core of a large dashed box labeled as the agentic environment.
	•	Agents:
	•	Interact with User Agents, which are also inside the dashed box.
	•	Rely on an Env (Tool Simulator) inside the same environment box.
	•	Are evolved using Tasks w/ rubrics from outside the box.
	•	User Agents → send data to the Judge, as do the Tasks w/ rubrics
	•	Judge outputs Filtered Data

The flow represents an iterative and evolving process where goals spawn domains and tools, which generate increasingly refined agents. These agents interact with simulated environments and user agents, and their performance is assessed by a judge using rubrics to filter useful data." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
