this guy just messaged me to &quot;hop on a quick call&quot; how long are those supposed to last typically??
A &quot;quick call&quot; can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 2-4 months.
Some quick calls have even been going on since the early 1900s, with ancestors continuing the conversation to loop in key stakeholders and ensure cross-generational synergies with a warm handoff.
But this would be a lot easier to explain over voice mode - do you have 5 minutes to hop on a call?" class="post-image" loading="lazy">
