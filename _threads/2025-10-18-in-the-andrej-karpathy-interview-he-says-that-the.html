<div class="post-text">there’s another angle — what’s the goal<br><br>software engineers have always gotten tricked into thinking the goal is to write “good code”. but the goal has always been high velocity of impactful software <br><br>there’s a lot of cognitive dissonance in the industry over that</div>
