First, of course, it's to gain reputation. If K2 were only a closed-source service, it definitely wouldn't have this much attention and discussion now. It might even suffer criticism like Grok4 despite doing well.
Second, we can leverage community efforts to improve the technical ecosystem. Within 24 hours of open-sourcing, we saw the community create K2's MLX implementation,
4-bit quantization, etc. - things we really couldn't do with our limited manpower.
But more importantly: open source means higher technical standards, forcing us to create better models, more aligned with AGI goals." class="post-image" loading="lazy">

I've heard rumors that some major companies have dozens of models, hundreds of scenario classifications, and countless workflows behind their interfaces, claiming this is an &quot;MoE model.&quot; Under &quot;application-first&quot; or &quot;user experience-first&quot; values, this approach is very natural and far more cost-effective than a single model.
But this clearly isn't what AGI should look like. For a startup like Kimi, this approach not only makes you increasingly mediocre and greatly hinders technical progress but also makes it impossible to compete with major companies that have PMs polishing every button." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
