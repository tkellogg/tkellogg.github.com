Today we are launching my favorite feature of ChatGPT so far, called Pulse. It is initially available to Pro subscribers.
Pulse works for you overnight, and keeps thinking about your interests, your connected data, your recent chats, and more. Every morning, you get a custom-generated set of stuff you might be interested in.
It performs super well if you tell ChatGPT more about what's important to you. In regular chat, you could mention &quot;I'd like to go visit Bora Bora someday&quot; or &quot;My kid is 6 months old and I'm interested in developmental milestones&quot; and in the future you might get useful updates.
Think of treating ChatGPT like a super-competent personal assistant: sometimes you ask for things you need in the moment, but if you share general preferences, it will do a good job for you proactively." class="post-image" loading="lazy">

This is an early look, and right now only available to Pro subscribers. We will work hard to improve the quality over time and to find a way to bring it to Plus subscribers too.
Huge congrats to @ChristinaHartW, @_samirism, and the team for building this." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
