⸻

🧠 How It Works

1. Mutual Predictability Scoring (Top Section)
	•	You start with a set of labeled examples — each statement (e.g., “Claim A is True,” “Claim B is False,” etc.).
	•	For each example, you ask the model to predict the labels of all items in that example (e.g., “Claim B is False; Claim C is True; Claim A is True”).
	•	The model assigns a probability score (log‑probability) to each predicted label.
	•	You sum those log-probs across claims in a single example, yielding a joint likelihood score (This is P_A, P_B, P_C, etc.).
	•	High scores mean the labels are collectively consistent and predictable.

2. Search & Update Procedure (Bottom Section)
	•	Start with existing data D (seed examples) and its aggregated utility score U(D).
	•	Sample new data — for example, a new statement (“5+5=10 is True”).
	•	The model proposes consistent label combinations for this new data (D’), each with its own utility score U(D’).
	•	Compare:
\Delta = U(D’) - U(D)
	•	Use a stochastic acceptance test:
	•	If \Delta is high (makes data more predictable), you accept and update your dataset (thumbs up ✋).
	•	If not, you reject (thumbs down 👎).

⸻

🔍 Why It Matters
	•	Consistency-focused labeling: The model tries to predict labels for all claims at once, rather than one at a time, so you favor sets that are mutually coherent.
	•	Data-driven expansion: Only new examples that increase overall predictability are kept, making the labeling process more robust and reliable.
	•	Probabilistic selection: The stochastic update rule helps avoid traps or overfitting by not always accepting even improvements, leading to more balanced datasets." class="post-image" loading="lazy">

For instance, although individual humans have become more intelligent in the last 100,000 years, human societies have become exponentially more capable in the information age because of our collective intelligence and ability to coordinate. Even generally-intelligent agents face limits when operating as individuals; groups of agents can accomplish far more." class="quote-image" loading="lazy"></div>
