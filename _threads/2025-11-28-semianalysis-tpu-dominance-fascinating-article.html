We also revealed that the reason for these order increases was the fact that Google would begin selling systems externally to multiple customers. In early September, we revealed that one of the big external customers will be Anthropic, with demand of at least 1 million TPUs. This was officially confirmed by Anthropic and Google in October. We also called out Meta as a big TPU customer on the 7th of November, weeks before others. In addition we have discussed other customers as well." class="post-image" loading="lazy">

We believe the core issue is contractual and administrative. Each new datacenter vendor requires a Master Services Agreement, and these are multibillion-dollar, multiyear commitments that naturally involve some bureaucracy. Yet Google's process is especially slow, often taking up to three years from initial discussions to a signed MSA." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
