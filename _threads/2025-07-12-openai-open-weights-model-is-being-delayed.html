@sama
we planned to launch our open-weight model next week.
we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us.
while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can't be pulled back. this is new for us and we want to get it right.
sorry to be the bearer of bad news; we are working super hard!

@Yuchenj_UW•1d
Rumors that OpenAl delayed their open-source model because of Kimi are fun, but from what I hear:
- the model is much smaller than Kimi K2 (<< 1T parameters)
- super powerful
- but due to some (frankly absurd) reason I can't say, they realized a big issue just before release, so they probably have to retrain now...
Hope we get to meet &quot;her&quot; soon." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
