PSA: there's a guy named Soham Parekh (in
India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He's been preying on YC companies and
more. Beware.
••
I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn't stopped a year later. No more excuses.

I currently have 10 fully remote engineering jobs.
The bar is so low, oversight is non-existent, and everyone is so forgiving for under performance I can coast about 4-8 weeks before a given job fires me.
Currently on a $1.5M run-rate for comp this year.
And the interviewing process is so much faster today, companies are desperate, it takes me 2-3hrs of total effort to land a new job with thousands to chose from." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
