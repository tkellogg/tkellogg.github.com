Dario Amodei talks about how the Al labs are dealing with a &quot;cone of uncertainty&quot;.
They are making data center and compute bets now that don't come online for 2+ years. If they undershoot, competition takes share. If they overshoot, could go bankrupt.
He says Anthropic's enterprise focus reduces the uncertainty because the margins are much larger than in consumer market.
Even if revenue slows (annual sales have gone from $100m to ~$10B in two years), Anthropic can better forecast its compute needs in enterprise market and margin cushions the blow from any overspend." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
