A presenter stands beneath it on a red circular carpet, wearing a dark T-shirt and dark pants, holding a clicker.

Slide title (top, in large red text):
“The Problem: Most Codebases Lack Sufficient Verifiability”

Subheading in smaller text:
“Humans work around incomplete infrastructure. AI agents cannot.”

The slide is divided into two rounded pink boxes:

⸻

Left box: “What Humans Can Handle”

A bulleted list in red text:
	•	60% test coverage (“I’ll test manually”)
	•	Outdated docs (“I’ll ask the team”)
	•	No linters/formatters (“I’ll review it”)
	•	Flaky builds (“I’ll retry”)
	•	Complex setup (“I’ll help onboard”)
	•	Missing observability (“Check logs”)
	•	No security scanning (“We’ll catch it later”)
	•	Inconsistent patterns (“I know the history”)

⸻

Right box: “What Breaks AI Agents”

Bulleted list with each line marked by a red “X”:
	•	No tests → can’t validate correctness
	•	Outdated docs → makes wrong assumptions
	•	No quality checks → generates bad code
	•	Flaky builds → can’t verify changes
	•	Complex setup → can’t reproduce environment
	•	No observability → can’t debug failures
	•	No security checks → introduces vulnerabilities
	•	No standards → creates inconsistency

⸻

At the bottom in a wide pink bar:
“Most organizations have partial infrastructure across the eight pillars. AI agents need systematic coverage to succeed.”
