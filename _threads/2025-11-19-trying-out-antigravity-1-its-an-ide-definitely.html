```
'str' object has no attribute 'name'
```

…and you're seeing this specifically when calling **Veo-3.0-fast-generate-001** operations.

Here’s what’s actually going on.

---

## ✅ **Why you’re getting `'str' object has no attribute 'name'`**

Somewhere in your code, you are treating a **string** as if it were a structured response object returned by the Veo API. Most likely you expected something like:

```python
operation = client.operations.get(...)
print(operation.name)
```

But instead, **`operation` is actually a string**—probably the operation ID itself, not an object.

This happens when the Veo SDK returns:

```python
operation_id = response.id  # string
```

But your code assumes:

```python
operation.name
```

---

## 🔥 **Where in your logs it appears**

You can see it happening right after this line:

```
Operation started: models/veo-3.0-fast-generate-001/operations/ekc0xkjedpqw
```

You're then calling something like:

```python
operation = poll_operation(...)
operation.name   # ‼️ error here
```

---

## 🎯 **How to fix it**

### **Veo Fast returns a *string operation ID*** — you must call the Operations API to fetch the object:

```python
operation_id = response.id  # string

while True:
    operation = client.operations.get(operation_id)

    if operation.done:
        break

    time.sleep(3)
```

And only after retrieving the full operation do you get:

```python
operation.name
operation.metadata
operation.response  # final video result
```

---

## ✔ Corrected version of your polling code

```python
def wait_for_operation(client, operation_id):
    while True:
        op = client.operations.get(operation_id)  # get full object

Just tell me what direction you want next:

* Try Veo 3.1 Preview again with quota-safe guards?

* Generate a full narrated cut?
* Or start refining scenes / pacing?
