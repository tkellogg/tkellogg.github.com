A LinkedIn post by Tim Kellogg under the AI & Engineering category titled “AI Cheat Sheet.” The post humorously attempts to clarify AI model naming conventions, listing various models and their definitions:
	•	o1 – A reasoning model from OpenAI
	•	o2 – Skipped due to naming conflicts
	•	o3 – A better reasoning model, not yet released
	•	o3-mini – A smaller, faster, cheaper reasoning model similar to o1
	•	4o – Short for GPT-4o, previously the state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal LLM
	•	o4 – An unreleased reasoning model
	•	r1 – A reasoning model from DeepSeek, on par with o1
	•	s1 – A reasoning model that is “not terribly important except that it CHANGES EVERYTHING”
	•	t1 – A reasoning model that does not exist but is theorized to follow t-1, which also does not exist
	•	Deep Research – An OpenAI agent that uses reinforcement learning
	•	Deep Research – A Google agent that does not use reinforcement learning

The post ends with: “Hopefully that clears things up!”
