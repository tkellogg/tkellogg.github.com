“Did… we just achieve AGI?
Gary Marcus benchmark solved”

Below the tweet is an embedded post from Gary Marcus (@GaryMarcus), also verified, displaying his profile picture with a circular frame containing the text “Beyond 2030.” His tweet reads:
“Deep Research is genuinely useful.”

The post appears to be a humorous reference to Gary Marcus, a well-known AI skeptic, seemingly acknowledging the value of deep research, which some users interpret as an indirect concession regarding AI progress. The tweet by Chubby suggests that this statement marks a significant milestone, possibly jokingly implying that artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been achieved." class="post-image" loading="lazy">

“Gary Marcus is a contra indicator. If he thinks something is useful then with high probability it is not useful.”

The tweet suggests that Gary Marcus, known for his skepticism about AI advancements, is often wrong in his assessments of what is valuable. The user implies that if Marcus finds something useful, it is likely not actually useful. The tweet has 3 replies, 23 likes, and 940 views." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
