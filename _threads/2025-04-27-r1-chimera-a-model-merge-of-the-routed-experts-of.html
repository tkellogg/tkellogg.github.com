The x-axis represents “Inference cost in % of R1 output tokens” and ranges from 30 to 100. The y-axis represents “Intelligence score (AIME 24 & MT-Bench)” and ranges from 70 to 90.

Four points are plotted:
	•	V3 in green near (40, 75)
	•	R1T in light blue near (70, 87)
	•	R1 in red at (100, 85)
	•	A light blue label “R1T Chimera [V3+R1]” next to R1T
	•	DeepSeek V3-0324 in green, associated with V3
	•	DeepSeek R1 in red, associated with R1

Two blue arrows labeled “smarter” and “faster” point respectively upward and leftward toward the R1T point, suggesting that R1T is both smarter (higher intelligence score) and faster (lower inference cost) compared to R1.

At the bottom left, the Twitter handle @tngtech is present. The overall design is clean, with the plot emphasizing how models compare in terms of intelligence and efficiency." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
