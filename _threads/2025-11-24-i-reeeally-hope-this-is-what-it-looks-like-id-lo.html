“Tomorrow”

Below the text is a photo showing two men standing in a well-lit recording studio setup. They are smiling and posing for the camera. One is wearing a maroon polo shirt and jeans; the other is wearing a graphic T-shirt, hoodie, and cargo-style pants. A large softbox studio light is positioned to the right, and a tall plant in a pot sits beside them. In the foreground is a wooden table with a laptop, a microphone arm, and a glass of water. Vertical blinds cover the window behind them.

The tag at the bottom identifies Ilya Sutskever. The timestamp reads 12:03 PM · 11/24/25 · 523K Views." class="post-image" loading="lazy">
