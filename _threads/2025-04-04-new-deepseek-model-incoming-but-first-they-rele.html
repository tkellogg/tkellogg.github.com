Key observations:
	•	DeepSeek-GRM-27B (MetaRM@k) (Ours) is the top performer, shown with a red line and star markers, rising steeply and leveling near 72.5.
	•	DeepSeek-GRM-27B (Voting@k) (Ours) follows, in blue with stars, peaking slightly above 70.5.
	•	GPT-4o (Greedy) is shown as a gray dashed line, sitting just under 71.
	•	Other models, shown in orange, green, brown, and gray lines (scalar or voting methods), plateau between ~66.5 and ~68.5.
	•	LLM-as-a-Judge w/ TokenProb, Skywork-Reward-Gemma-2-27B, and DeepSeek-BTRM-27B are among these lower-performing models.

<div class="post-text">one trick they used was to replace scalar grades with critiquing the source<br><br>which, yeah, that does seem like it would help</div>

Top section (RFT):
	•	GRM samples responses using Q&R (question & response) and evaluates using predefined principles like “Instruction Adherence,” “Safety,” “Clarity,” and “Relevance.”
	•	Scored responses are extracted and categorized (e.g. 2/10, 4/10; 6/10, 1/10) for training rule and reward modules.
	•	Some responses are flagged as “Too Easy/Incorrect.”

Middle section (RL):
	•	GRM rolls out responses with principles like “Logic Chain Correctness” and “Completeness.”
	•	Responses are compared and scored for rule/reward extraction, leading to online or offline updates.

Bottom section (Inference):
	•	Uses parallel sampling of responses via GRM.
	•	A wide variety of principles guide evaluation: “Technical Accuracy,” “Practical Implementation,” “Language Proficiency,” “Engagement,” etc., each with specific weights.
	•	Critiques are shown for each comparison, and final scores are computed for the responses.
	•	Scores from multiple sets are collected and passed to a Voting module or a Meta RM which combines multiple critiques to produce final Rewards.

Right side:
	•	Color-coded scores show how different responses (1 to 4) fare across principles.
	•	Voting simply aggregates outcomes (e.g., 17/40), while Meta RM uses weighted reasoning from critiques across principles (e.g., 5/20, 13/20).

Caption summary:
SPCT uses a principle-based framework for fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, guiding inference-time behavior. Naive voting and Meta RM approaches scale critique-guided scoring, providing nuanced reward signals across a broad value space.
