Add or update a lesson every time you think you're done.
They're so that you can topically organize things you're learning about the technology, environment, me, etc.
Write things here that make it easier to navigate technology, errors, clever solutions, etc.
Also, you should heavily reference what's written in here while performing activities. I recommend reading
every file before doing anything else.

<div class="post-text">fwiw it does not take these instructions literally. i had to force it to write the first few. after that, it seems to re-discover the lessons when it's doing full text searches, and that often provides quick cures</div>
