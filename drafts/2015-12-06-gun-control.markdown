title: The Gun Control Argument Is Pointless

I grew up in a small town in upstate NY immersed in gun culture. My adult life has been immersed 
in quite the opposite - liberal urban areas saturated with tech workers. Most of the people reading
this likely believe gun control is a moral issue and anything short of revoking guns should be 
viewed as a societal failure. Both sides of this debate have remarkably good arguments that the 
other refuses to listen to. Also, nobody seems to have ideas that are likely to actually fix
_the problem_.


What Is The Problem?
====================

Yesterday I glanced at a Time magazine dated a little over a week ago and realized that the cover
story was about a gun tragety. The problem is, there have been at least 2 or 3 more gun trageties
since then, so it was old news. This is crazy. Prior to Columbine in 1999, these mass shootings 
were relatively unheard of but they are now weekly news. Somthing needs to change.


Solution: Take All The Guns Away
--------------------------------

This seems to be intuitive. People kill each other with guns, so if you take the guns away they
have to use something else. You can walk into a movie theatre with a gun and kill quite a lot of 
people, but the same cannot be said for a knife. Also, inner cities are being torn apart by gun 
violence. Guns, in cities, are really only used for violence, so why on earth would you allow
them to be bought and sold freely?

This side of the debate takes on a strong moral component. Guns are used to kill people. They 
have no apparent useful contribution to society, so how can it be moral to own a gun? (More on this later)


Solution: Arm Every Man, Woman and Child
----------------------------------------

If everyone has a gun and is taught how to properly and safely handle guns, then they can defend
themselves as well as society around them. If a shooter walks into a movie theatre, they will 
only be able to pop a couple rounds off before one of the 27 gun carrying moviegoers takes them 
down.


Neither Of These Will Work
==========================
