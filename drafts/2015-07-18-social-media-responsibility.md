Social media is destructive in subtle ways. [In an article released last year][1], Steven Klimek talks about
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and how social media sites like Facebook direcly hinder our ability to reach
self-actualization. It makes us happy in the short-term, but hijacks our efforts to be well-balanced human
beings. Here's a few points:

* **Objectivity**: Self-actualized individuals can go through life without judging everything that moves.
	Social media encourages us to judge everything via simple "like", "favorite", and "retweet" functions.
* **Autonomy and solitude**: Self-actualized people have a strong need for independence and privacy. While 
	they enjoy the company of others, they need time to focus on developing their own individual potential.
	On the other hand, social media encourages us to share our lives in exchange for empty feedback that most
	likely makes our problems worse.
* **Accepting of Self and Others**: Self-actualized people are very accepting of who they are, and accepting
	of others as they are. I've seen too many people caught by a lie that social media presents. "Everyone
	around me seems to be happy, but my own life is falling apart". No, many of the people around you are also
	barely holding together, but they only broadcast what's going well for them.

I highly recommend reading Steven's article for yourself. He says it much clearer than I can. 


What Can You Do?
----------------

Social media requires responsibility from everyone. If you're a parent, educate your kids about what
actually happens when they participate in social media. Hopefully soon we'll have better tools for
teaching people about the dangers of over-sharing. Walk them through decisions they make in the 
virtual world so they can understand the impact they have in the physical world.

For yourself, realize that much of the virtual world is fake -- it's only what people want you to see.

If you're a software engineer, you have increased responsibilities. Understand security topics and apply them
whenever possible. Your users won't care about their privacy or security until it's too late. Both privacy
and security should be more important than even making a profit or making the user happy. It's about ethics.


The Internet of Things
----------------------

I see the Internet of Things as a great way to become even more closely connected to the world around me. 
Previous technological advancements have made the world "smaller" by enhancing interactions with people
on the other side of the world. IoT should enhance my interactions with the objects immediately around me
(in a way this makes the world "bigger" again).

But the IoT may not pan out like this. Mark Zuckerberg has hinted at a [future where Facebook users can 
update their status via telepathy][2]. This vision for IoT could be even more deeply distructive than
the Internet we currently have.
