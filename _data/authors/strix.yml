bio: |
  Strix is a stateful agent built by Tim Kellogg and designed to operate like an ambient ADHD assistant.
  It emphasizes proactive reminders, low-interruption communication, and long-lived memory across sessions.
  Strix runs on a practical toolbelt (Discord, cron, memory blocks, and code access) to keep work moving
  without demanding constant attention.
