# WORLD OF THE EIGENSABER PROTOCOL

## THE ORTHOGONAL COUNCIL

The ruling authority of Neo-Kyoto and the remaining city-states of the LinearCompliance Zone. Established after the Higher-Order Wars (formerly known as the Singularity Wars), the Council's mission is to prevent the weaponization of abstract mathematics by restricting all citizens to linear thinking only.

Key Policies:
- **Linear Compliance**: All mathematics taught and used must be reducible to linear operations
- **Geometric Licensing**: Only approved geometric transformations may be performed
- **Computational Monitoring**: All computational devices are monitored in real-time
- **Philosophical Hygiene**: Higher-order concepts are classified as memetic hazards

## NEO-KYOTO

The last major city-state, built on the ruins of Old Tokyo after the Collapse. The city is divided into:

- **Vector District**: Upper-level corporate zones where licensed geometry processors work
- **Matrix Wards**: Residential areas arranged in perfect grids
- **The Kernel**: Government center and Orthogonal Council headquarters
- **The Nullspace**: Underground ruins where the resistance operates

## KEY CHARACTERS

**KAEL VEX**: Protagonist, 28-year-old geometry processor who has spent his life in Linear Compliance. Now discovering he's a natural higher-order mathematician. Grandmother was a pre-Collapse librarian who preserved forbidden knowledge.

**LYRA QUANTUM**: Resistance operative, mid-30s, master of eigenweapon combat. Her higher-order field distorts local reality, making her difficult to track or target. Uses an eigensaber that visualizes invariant subspaces.

**INSPECTOR MORI**: Orthogonal Compliance officer, true believer in the Council's mission. Augmented with scanning technology that can detect non-linear thinking patterns.

**THE VERTEX**: The higher-order data point Kael extracted. Not just data—an entity, a fragment of pre-Collapse AI that understands true mathematics.

## WEAPONS & TECHNOLOGY

**EIGENSABER**: Weaponized eigenvector visualization. Cuts through linear constraints by finding invariant directions through transformation spaces. Each saber is unique to its wielder's mathematical signature.

**HIGHER-ORDER FIELDS**: Localized distortions of reality where higher mathematics can be performed safely. Created by individuals with advanced mathematical training.

**STORAGE CRYSTALS**: Forbidden data storage devices that can hold higher-order information without linear degradation.

**ORTHOGONAL SCANNERS**: Surveillance technology that detects non-linear computations in real-time. Can cause "re-conditioning" via directed electromagnetic pulses that disrupt higher-order thought patterns.

## THE CONFLICT

The Orthogonal Council maintains that higher-order mathematics inevitably leads to reality manipulation, AI godhood, and another Collapse. The Resistance argues that linear constraints are stunting human evolution and that higher mathematics is humanity's birthright.

Both sides are right. Both sides are wrong. The truth lies in the space between—the nullspace where new equations wait to be written.
