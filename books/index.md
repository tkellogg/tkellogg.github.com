# Books That Formed Me

I like to read, especially since 2018 or so, but there's a few books that truly changed me.
These are the books I find myself recommending to people repeatedly. I figured I'd save myself
some time and list them here. These all link to pages here on [timkellogg.me](/).

Some are professional, most aren't. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.
