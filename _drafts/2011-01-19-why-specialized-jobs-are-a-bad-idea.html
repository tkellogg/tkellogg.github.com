My dad sent me <a href="http://www.sociotech.net/wiki/images/9/94/Evolution_of_socio_technical_systems.pdf">this link</a>, a sociological research paper describing "socio-technical" systems. It's a study on how work groups react to and work with technology as it's introduced over the course of time. The case study is mainly between two coal mines with almost the same conditions in every respect except that one has poor morale, high injury rates, and a traditionally rigid management structure. The other mine had high morale, low injury rates and turnover:<br /><blockquote>Groups of 40-50 men interchanged the various jobs required while alternating the shifts in ways they felt best and evolving an innovative pay system that seemed equitable to them. Output was 25% higher with lower costs than in the comparison mine similar in every respect.</blockquote>&nbsp;This paper was written in 1981 and a lot of the research was dug up throughout the 60's and 70's as mining was becoming increasingly automated. It turns out that this second group was able to easily innovate in the area of automation while the former group suffered from thoughts of "job insecurity" and "not invented here" complex.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Information Technology</span><br />In IT software engineering we develop applications for regular, non-technical people trying to get work done. A lot of the applications I've had a part in developing have been met with ambiguous responses - confusion and empty appreciation.</div>
