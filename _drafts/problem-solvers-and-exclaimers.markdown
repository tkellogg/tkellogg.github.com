title: Problem Identifiers

Engineers excel in solving problems. They delight themselves in their ability
to produce creative solutions to complex problems. The delight sometimes 
becomes so strong that we [destroy the value of our product][1] with our
[creative solutions][2]. Most teams are missing the more critical part of problem solving - identifying the problem. 

Sure, every problem solving tutorial lists this as a critical step in the 
process. But we forget (or don't know) that problem solving is an iterative
process. It especially hurts when neglected problems become the foundation of
an application or infrastructure.
