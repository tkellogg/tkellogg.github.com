As far as I know, no you can't follow RSS feeds on mastodon. But what if you could? It could be
very powerful!

This weekend, it seems that everyone in my world has migrated from Twitter over to Mastodon, and
it's got me thinking a lot about Internet standards and protocols. I used to read news via news 
aggregators like Google Reader that would combine a bunch of RSS feeds together into one place.

RSS is short for [Really Simple Syndication][def]. It's an XML file format that provides a list
of entries with a title, short blurb and a link (plus [a bunch of other fields][fields]). Even
this blog that you're reading has an [Atom feed][feed], which is very similar to RSS. My site is
Jekyll, a static site generator, which means the entire feed is constructed and cached only when
the content changes. Its refreshingly simple.

The entire Internet worked like this before social media. Social media swooped in and gave us an
algorithm for discovering content. Admittedly, the algorithm was kind of nice to have. I suddenly
had a curated feed populated by the people who I want to be influenced by. It seemed all-around better.
Syndication largely died of in lieu of social media presence, but I think that should change.


## Why mastodon?
Well, first, [Mastodon][music] has a unique and heavy sound. But seriously, federated social media
really feels like it's in the spririt of the original Internet. It has that "I have no master"
feel of the early web and email, in that if you ever get fed up with the content moderation, you
can just switch servers. No biggie!

But also it's also efficient. Recent financial numbers indicate that Twitter costs about [$22 per
active user per year][mau]. On the other hand, [fosstodon.org][foss], my preferred mastodon instance,
has [27K users][fosscost] costing $1,200 per year at a cost of $0.04 per user. My personal belief is
that the drive toward profit causes sites like Twitter to spend excessively to become the biggest 
network with the best ROI on advertisements. Doing so requires a lot of invasive data capturing
and analysis. Mastodon & the fediverse really don't care if they're big. As such, they simply don't
have operating costs nearly in the same realm as Twitter & Facebook.

The fediverse is the future, for this reason. Sooner or later, investors are going to figure out
that social networks don't have the ROI of most software operations. When that happens, it's going 
to be the fediverse that's left.
