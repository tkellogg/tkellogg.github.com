I recently changed jobs. In my old job I had the pleasure of using Git on a day-to-day basis. In my new job I still get to use Git via <a href="http://schacon.github.com/git/git-svn.html" target="_blank">git-svn</a>. As a result, I've started getting forced into a rebase workflow (Subversion forces rebases to maintain a linear history).<br /><br />I thought I would hate SVN dearly after getting to use Git. But honestly, there's only a handful of times when pure Git is advantageous over git-svn. Most of the time I'm happy with being able to manage tiny commits locally and share what I want with the rest of the team.<br /><br />One of the advantages (probably the only) of git-svn is that I don't have to explain Git to my coworkers.<br /><br /><br /></div>
