In a <a href="http://timkellogg.blogspot.com/2010/06/couchdb-ext-as-replacement-for-server.html">previous post</a> I described a possible new model of developing web  applications. While that post dealt mainly with the technical aspects,  in this post I want to talk about the business practicality of the  model. All too often programmers forget that the sole reason for the  existence of corporations is to make money. If production and overhead  costs rise too high, net income falls and growth (regardless of how huge  the demand is) will be stifled. The purpose of this post is to bring  technical people down to earth and business people "into the cloud" regarding this design paradigm - as well as any other design paradigm.<br /><br />I   separate business practicality into production costs, maintenance   costs, and sales revenue generation. Production costs are the costs   involved in creating the code and debugging it to launch it into production for the first time. Maintenance costs are for   keeping the code and infrastructure in line, bug fixes, and keeping up as demand grows   and scalability becomes more important. I don't believe revenue   generation is particularly relevant to this conversation since it has   more to do with ideas and execution, not particularly the framework that   it lies on.<br /><br /><b>Production Costs</b> <br /><br />I believe that there is a  correlation between programmer  performance and the number of  languages/technologies they have to know  and work with. If a programmer  has to know HTTP, HTML, C#, ASP.NET, SQL,  JavaScript, and CSS, their  performance will be inherently low. The high  performers and leaders  will be struggling to keep up with changes that  are made to these  technologies over the coming months and years. The low  performers will  approach complete uselessness as they are swimming in  seemingly magical  technologies that they will never fully understand.  The mid-level  performers will grasp a few (or maybe several) of these  technologies  but never fully understand the whole system.<br /><br />From  a managerial standpoint, the best way to reduce costs in  initial  development stages is to reduce the complexity of the work. By  using  Ext + CouchDB we eliminate C#, ASP.NET and SQL and add in CouchDB   instead (which is a very simple alternative API to SQL and integrates   smoothly with JavaScript). Rather than learning a new language for   querying the database (SQL) CouchDB uses JavaScript as a query language.   Web developers are already using JavaScript to animate their browsers,   so this is a logical choice. The drawbacks to using JavaScript as the   language for business logic (replacement of C#/ASP.NET) are that   development tools are less developed and powerful for JavaScript.   However, tools like Firebug are closing this gap.<br /><br /><b>Maintenance Costs</b> <br /><br />I think these costs would rise slightly but  generally  stay the same as demand lies constant. Administrators would  have to be  trained in maintaining a new kind of database, but the web  server  administration would be the same as always, maybe even simpler.  As  demand spikes and managers start talking about clouds, average costs   will really start to pay off as this is where the Ext + CouchDB approach   will really pay off.</div>
