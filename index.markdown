I live in Boulder, Colorado where I write software. I like to write about aspects of code and software 
engineering that intrigue me. I recommend checking out [my blog](/posts.html) if you're also interested
in code.

I recently exported my blog from blogger and am working to fix any glitches that are hanging around. I 
moved away from blogger because I hated writing code snippets with their interface. Now I'm using github
pages with jekyll so I can blog in markdown. Better yet, I have full control over the layout with CSS 
and layout pages.
