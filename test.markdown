This is my **personal** _and professional_ web site. I love `to code` things like

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
function blah() {
	return void(0);
}
{% endhighlight %}

and a really long block of code
{% highlight csharp %}
public class Foo {
	public Foo(Constructor argument) :base() { this.constructor = constructor; } // a really really long line that probably won't fit
}
{% endhighlight %}

some text here too
