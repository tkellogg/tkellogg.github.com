# Change Consulting

Struggling with change? I help companies retain talent by refocusing their engineers.

I've been through a lot of acquisitions (one employment only lasted 
for three weeks!). I've mentored countless engineers to help them resolve the tension between _the way 
things were_ and _the way things are_ now. I'm passionate about helping people find a way to be content
and excited about their work, even if it's not what they imagined they would be doing.

In the past, I've helped individuals and teams understand what made their old organization function smoothly
as well as the challenges and opportunities of the new organization. Many engineers dismiss this sort
of thinking as "politics", but it's fundamental to how we design software and the trade-offs we make.

## How I Can Help
* Work with management to fine-tune their messaging of organizational change
* Work with teams to adjust their expectations and improve morale
* Help employees understand when it's time to move on

## Example: An Acquisition
I helped a team re-envision the purpose of their work after an acquisition.

| --- | ---- |
| Old | Resource-constrained startup |
| New | Mid-sized company with poor technology |
| Old Challenge | Cost reduction |
| New Challenge | Project success rate |
| Valued | Laser focus on cost reduction & efficiency |
| Valued Now | Simple code optimized for rapid delivery. Enabling less experienced engineers to be successful. |

## Example: A Job Change

An engineer was discontent with his new job because they didn't seem as serious as his last job.
I helped him understand the new organization's values and suggested some ways he could stand out.

| Old | Major cloud provider |
| New | Online retailer |
| Old Challenge | Availability & latency are paramount |
| New Challenge | Acquiring revenue by expanding into new markets |
| Valued | Operational discipline |

## Example: End of the Road

I helped a computer scientist understand that the new acquiring company didn't have a use for their
work. Management tried to move them into a new job role. I helped them understand their discontent and
connected them with future employer that valued their skills.

## About Me
I've been an engineering manager, tech lead, senior engineer, and principal engineer at a variety of
companies of various sizes, shapes and purposes. Across my 15+ years of experience, I've always been
passionate about helping others understand why they're no longer happy at work. I've helped countless
peers and subordinates see and resolve their cognitive dissonance. I'd be delighted to help you too!
