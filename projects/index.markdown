        <h2>Open Source Projects</h2>
        <p>Over time I've contributed to a number of open source projects. I've become aware of several projects that do excellent work and solve great problems, but are in need of help. I started <a href="/projects/open-source.html">a list</a> of several of such projects. I encourage everyone to <a href="/blog/2012/04/22/why-open-source-is-worth-your-time/">contribute to open source</a>, so please look over the list and suggest any that I might be missing.</p>

            <h3>fossil</h3>
            <p>An AI-driven mastodon client that works for me. It groups posts by similar content, so I can spend less time in social media while still retaining all the benefits I get from it.</p>
