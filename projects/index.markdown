This is a listing of links to things I've put together. Some are big, some small. But I hope they're all useful
one way or another.

Migrating from Blogger to Jekyll
-----------------

I wrote [html2md](/html2md.rb) to convert html that was generated by Blogger into 
markdown consumable by Jekyll. This takes care of most issues that I had (including
converting gists to pygments blocks) but you should read through the script before
executing. I used [juniorz import script](https://gist.github.com/1564581) to convert
my blogger posts into jekyll-consumable HTML.
