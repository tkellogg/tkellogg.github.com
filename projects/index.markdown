Open Source Projects
--------------------

Over time I've contributed to a number of open source projects. I've become aware of several projects that do 
excellent work and solve great problems, but are in need of help. I started [a list](/projects/open-source.html) of
several of such projects. I encourage everyone to 
[contribute to open source](/blog/2012/04/22/why-open-source-is-worth-your-time/), so please look over the list and
suggest any that I might be missing.

Migrating from Blogger to Jekyll
-----------------

I wrote [html2md](/html2md.rb) to convert html that was generated by Blogger into 
markdown consumable by Jekyll. This takes care of most issues that I had (including
converting gists to pygments blocks) but you should read through the script before
executing. I used [juniorz import script](https://gist.github.com/1564581) to convert
my blogger posts into jekyll-consumable HTML.
