title: Open Source Projects In Need Of Help
---

There are a lot of projects out there that have a lot of users and very few contributers. I've been running into
projects here and there that are aching for contributers, so I thought I'd list them.

VsVim
------

A Vim emulator for Visual Studio. The core is written in F# with tests and auxilary code written in C#. It's a great
project to contribute to if you want to learn about Vim, Visual Studio plugins, or F#. The big need on VsVim is just
more work. Issues flow in at a steadily increasing rate, but development continues at the same flat rate.

StructureMap
--------------

The oldest IoC container for .NET and Mono. Also (imo) the best user interface. It just does what you want. There is
a version 3 coming out after summer 2012. The big need points are bug fixes on the 2.x line and documentation. During
summer there will probably also be need to contribute refactoring and features for version 3.

Moq
------------

The revolutionary mocking library for C# and VB. Before Moq, mocking was hard. Now it's just fun. It's all written
in C#, great code coverage. It's also being completely rewritten for v5.0. I highly recommend patching some bugs now
if you want to get in on the architecture of version 5. I know there are some really interesting plans going into
it.
