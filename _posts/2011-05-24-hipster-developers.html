I'd like to know what the deal is with these new <i>hipster developers</i>, as I like to call them. You know, those guys who adore those new<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/01/wait-whats-nodejs-good-for-aga.php"> languages</a> and <a href="http://www.nonblocking.io/2011/04/jquery-module-anti-pattern.html">frameworks</a> until they start catching on. I mean, you have to respect them for putting in that initial work to bring <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/rails-3-1-adopts-coffeescript-jquery-sass-and-controversy-4669.html">technology</a> forward, but eventually they just become a headache. Honestly, does <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a> even have a chance of being a truly scalable solution?</div>
