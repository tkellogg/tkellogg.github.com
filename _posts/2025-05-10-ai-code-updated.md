    In January I wrote that software engineers would be replaced by people closer to the problem. I was
    wrong.

    Most people aren't the type of people that will push through problems to make software work.

Back in January I wrote, [Normware: The Decline of Software Engineering][post] and, while I think it was
generally well-reasoned, I was wrong. Or at least overly ambitious.

I predicted that software engineering as a profession is bound to decline and be replaced by less 
technical people with AI that are closer to the business problems. I no longer think that will happen, but
not for technical reasons, but for social reasons.

## What Changed
I saw people code.

I wrote the initial piece after using Cursor's agent a few times. Since then the tools have gotten even
more powerful and I can reliably one-shot entire non-trivial apps. I told a PM buddy about how I was doing
it and he wanted to try and... it didn't work. Not at all.

What I learned:

1. I'm using a lot of hidden technical skills
2. Yes, anyone can do it, but few will

On the surface it was stuff like, I'm comfortable in the terminal, he was not. And I don't freak out when
I get a huge error. But also softer skills, like how I know what complex code looks like vs simple code (with
AI coding, overly complex code will cause an agent to deadlock). Also, he tried including authentication in
the earliest version (lol n00b).

For some people, those are merely road blocks. I've talked to a few people with zero technical background that
are absolutely crushing it with code right now. It's hard, but they have the **drive** to push through the
hard parts. Sure, they've got their fair share of total flops, but they a strong will and push through.

Those are not common people. Most are weak, or just care about other things.

# How It Will happen
I suppose this scene hasn't unfolded and maybe my first take was right after all. But I don't think so.

It's likely that AI improves dramatically and makes it seamless to generate any code at any time. That
will certainly increase the pool of people willing to suffer through coding. But I don't think it **can**
shift enough such that the Normware vision pans out. Most people just aren't interested.

Instead, I think we'll see a steady decline of "boring code" jobs.

Someone at a very large tech company told me they worked on a (software engineering!!) team that did
nothing but make configuration changes. That's nuts. Over time, I think AI will chip away at these roles
until they're gone and replaced by code that engineers (say they) want to write. Early
prototypes and demo-quality software is already being replaced by AI, and the trend will continue from
that end as well.
