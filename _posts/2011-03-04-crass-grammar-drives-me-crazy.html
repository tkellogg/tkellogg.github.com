<div class='post'>
I recently had a conversation with someone that went something like:<br /><br /><i>Me:</i>&nbsp;Yeah, I went to the Sunflower market down on 287 &amp; South Boulder Rd<br /><i>PersonX:</i>&nbsp;That's one long ass walk<br /><br />How am I supposed to reply to that? I could say, "Not really, I wasn't ass walking the whole way" or "Yes, my ass is long, I should get in shape". No wonder people have such a hard time learning English...</div>
