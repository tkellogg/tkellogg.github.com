Thursday night I attended a lecture at the Boulder Linux user's group called <i><a href="http://sea.ucar.edu/event/unlocking-secrets-git">Unlocking the Secrets of Git</a></i> by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo">Tom</a>, one of the co-founders of <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a>. This was extremely eye-opening. Up until now I had viewed Git as simply a distributed version control system. Tom showed us how to manipulate Git's <a href="http://progit.org/book/ch9-2.html">internal file format</a> and demonstrated that Git is actually a filesystem in userspace with built-in versioning and synchronization. He demonstrated how, by storing a SHA1 hash of files, Git is (1) extremely fast at comparing files and (2) doesn't actually care about the file name - it just cares about the contents of files. This is important when you're renaming files - the filename is generally unimportant in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />Tom also showed us several open source projects that build upon the concept of Git as a filesystem. One was a <a href="http://github.com/apenwarr/bup">highly efficient backup system</a>. Another is a <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">static site generator</a>. There were many more. The point here is that Git is destined to be not just version control; it will be a feature-complete platform for anything that requires a filesystem with versioning and synchronization.<br /><br />The critical component to the success of Git as a plaform is <a href="http://libgit2.github.com/">libgit2</a>, a C library for interacting with Git. The reason why this is the critical component is that many people had been re-creating the functionality of Git. By combining this functionality into a library, the logic only has to be written once and can be used by everyone else. The other reason why this is a critical component is because libgit2 is being released under a permissive license that allows it to be easily used by many other people and projects without getting into any legal snafu's. <br /><br />Most importantly, Thursday night I realized that the tech community of Boulder is so complex and complete, I should never get bored here. I haven't lived here for a full six months yet but already I feel like I can't leave this city.</div>
