_TL;DR A total ban on guns is crap, but you should be required to prove that you're actually making society safer._

So, I can buy an AR-15 and plan a shootout for next Saturday. That is interesting.

I can understand why people are upset about guns. The thing about guns is that it's really easy to 
kill someone. Ever hear of someone walking into a movie theater and stabbing 70 people with a knife? 
Guns are easy to discharge - almost anyone has the strength and skill to do it. 

Guns are also an easy way to defend yourself. Which is why the constitution specifically highlights
firearms as a method reserved for future use to revolt against the government, if it ever becomes evil.
Although, I don't think our forefathers realized how powerful free speech can be when used on the
Internet (please see exhibit A, "Arab Spring"). 

Seems like everyone's all up in arms about gun control these days (no pun intended...well maybe a
little). There's been a lot of proposals, but they're all really hard for me to imagine actually working. 
If I had a voice in Washington I would want the law to be worded something like: 

"No person can own or operate an assault rifle as a civilian except for honorably discharged veterans,
current military officers or enlisted personnel at E3 level or higher, or persons who have passed an 80 hour
course. All assault rifle owners are required to serve as volunteer police (or some 
other analogous public safety service)."

If you own one of these dangerous weapons, regardless of who you are, you also have the responsibility
to protect the rest of us. It doesn't matter if you're ex-military or a civilian with a love for guns.
We won't give you the ability to kill people without fulfilling a responsibility to the rest of us. 
Letting you tote an assault rifle around our children is scary enough, the least we can ask is that
you prove that you'll use it to protect us.

If you are or have been in the military, I think we can trust you to not abuse your "power to kill
anyone you please". In fact, we appreciate your service to this country so much, we'll grant you that trust
for the rest of your life. _(I understand, not all military folk are gun savvy, but military service
has a way of vouching for their sanity.)_

The E3 requirement weeds out people who might not be mentally stable or are just trying to work the
system. It's not too hard to make E3, but it's hard enough that I think we can trust you. However,
if you get dishonorably discharged, your right to own an assault rifle is also revoked unless you
take the third option.

If you've never been in the military but believe you "absolutely must" own an extremely dangerous
weapon, I think you're crazy and I don't trust you for a minute. But, that policy probably won't fly
in gun-loving America so I'm willing to let you have one if you prove you know how to use it. 80 hours
comes to about 2 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks. This long course will cover, not only gun
safety, but also double as an intro to volunteer policing. I also think there should be a test at the
end to make sure you paid attention as well as a psych evaluation.

In this case, "assault rifle" is a placeholder term for "any gun that has the ability to be shot
multiple times without reloading". If you're "a hunter", I'm sure you love spraying the sky with bullets,
but I'm not willing to sacrifice my safety to satisfy your urge. 

If you're a serious hunter, you're probably good enough to hit your target with one shot. If you're not,
there's a reason they call it a sport. Learn to enjoy it. You might even like hunting more now that all the
nut jobs won't be interested in hunting anymore (should clear out the woods some).

This probably isn't perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better than what's currently being proposed. At 
the very least, it has enough small negotiable points that it's likely to make it through
congress in a meaningful form.
