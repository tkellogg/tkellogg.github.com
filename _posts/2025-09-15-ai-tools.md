A few people have asked me how I use AI coding tools. I don't think it's a straightforward answer.
For me it's not really a procedure or recipe, it's more of an ethos.


## Principle: Ownership
You own the code your AI produces.

Use your own name to commit AI code so that if something breaks, everyone **blames** you. This is critical. How well
do you need to know the code your AI produces? Well enough that you can answer for it's mistakes.

In lean manufacturing they have the principle of [Genchi genbutsu][gen], i.e. "go and **see for yourself**." In 
[_High Output Management_][hom], Andy Grove pushes "management by walking around". Andy defines the output
of a manager as the output of their entire org as well as the organizations under their influence.

The trouble with phrasing it as "AI coding" is it tricks you into thinking it's just another individual role
like software engineering, where it actually has a lot more in common with management. It's unfortunate we
hire and mentor for it as if it was software engineering.

* What does the algorithm _**actually**_ do?
* Did it find _**all**_ of the places to refactor?

Resist the urge to say, "oh, I _just_ vibe coded this". _You_ coded it, and if it sucks, it's because you
don't know how to manage your AI. Own it.


## Principle: Exploit Gradients
Not all time spent is equal. For some things, you can put in a **little** bit of effort and get a **huge** amount
of reward. In business, we call those **opportunities**.

Examples:

* _Biology_: A tiger migrates to where there's more food. _Less effort for more food._
* _Arbitrage_: Buy cheap, send to another country and sell expensive. _Less effort for more money._

AI coding isn't about writing code, it's about creating and exploiting gradients. Finding opportunities
where you can spend 10 minutes of AI time and reap a huge reward.

The contrived example is proof of concepts. You can **just do it**, figure out if it really works in practice
as it seems like it should, and abandon it quickly when it doesn't.

Or data analysis. Traditionally it was labor intensive to do data analysis, but you can spin out a sick
dashboard in a few minutes. Maybe that helps you avoid a dead end, or **push** your org in a new direction.

The key is to always be on the lookout for opportunities.

That feels a lot more like a shrewd businessman than a software engineer. Indeed! It's a mistake that
we transparently hire and promote software engineers into these roles. It's a new beast.


## How to become a AI Coder
I'm terrified of the future of software engineering. 

Oh, I'll continue having a job for a very long time. No concern about that. I'm worried that **junior**
engineers won't be promoted because it's easier to dispatch a request to an AI than to give juniors the
tasks that they traditionally learned the trade from.

But actually, this isn't software engineering.

If anyone with their head on straight can take ownership and exploit gradients, then maybe junior engineers
have an **edge** on seniors who are too stuck in their ways to realize they've been put in a new job role.

## Get out of your comfort zone
> I broadly agree with you, would only add that people do have to get out of their comfort zone to get good at AI, and you have some obligation to do that
>
> It's really hard to be good at it at first, as a manager you have to give people some slack to learn those new skills too

Yes, managers take note! We're learning a new job.

## Sense of ownership
> I enjoyed that. You're right about the sense of ownership. Although some developers never had a sense of ownership of even hand crafted code. I wrote about this topic recently and it chimes with your thoughts <https://www.aidanharding.com/2025/09/coding-with-ai/>

The good ones did.
