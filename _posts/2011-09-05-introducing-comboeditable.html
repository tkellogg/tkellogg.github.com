I'll admit, <a href="https://github.com/tkellogg/comboEditable">comboEditable </a>is an extremely dry name for an open source project (I would have used something like <i>Project Bierstadt</i>&nbsp;but it's not really that descriptive). Like everything else I develop and share publicly, this came out of necessity.<br /><br />In Windows there is a UI concept of an editable combo box. Basically you're given a drop down list of options and if you can't find the option you're looking for, you just type in another (see the <a href="http://tkellogg.github.com/comboEditable/">demo</a> if you're having trouble visualizing). This concept <i>does not exist</i>&nbsp;on the web or anywhere outside Windows applications. I assume that UX designers across the globe unanimously decided that an editable combo box is a UI kludge, but I still think it's a handy control.<br /><br />It is an unintrusive jQuery plugin that uses the regular HTML DOM as input and transforms into an editable combo box (a text box, hidden field and several divs, if you're wondering). The <i>unintrusive</i> part means that if scripts are disabled, the user still gets a combo box, just not an editable combo box.<br /><br />If you find yourself in need of an editable combo box, head over to the <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/comboEditable">jQuery plugin page</a> or download it at <a href="https://github.com/tkellogg/comboEditable">github</a>. Also, take a look at the <a href="http://tkellogg.github.com/comboEditable/">demo</a> to see usage.</div>
