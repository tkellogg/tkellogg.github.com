There's a lot of skepticism around A2A, Google's [Agent-to-Agent][a2a] protocol.
A lot of that is well earned. I mean, they launched a protocol with zero implementations.
But a lot's changed, and it's worth taking a look again. 

I'd like to convince you that you should be thinking about A2A as a protocol for giving 
agents a UI. And that **UI is a bridge** into a more complex multi-agent world. Gotta start
somewhere!

## It's Just HTTP
The protocol is just a single HTTP endpoint and an agent card (can be statically served).
Inside that single endpoint are JSON RPC methods:

- **`message/send` & `message/stream`** — Both send messages, one returns a [stream of events][sse] (SSE).
  The first message implicitly creates a task.
- **`tasks/resubscribe`** — For when you were doing `message/stream` but your connection broke.
- **`tasks/get`** — If you want to poll. SSE isn't for everyone, I guess. cURL works too.
- **`tasks/pushNotifications/set` & `.../get`** — for [webhooks][hook], if that's your thing

So basically, you create a task, and then you **exchange messages** with it. That's it.

### Tasks are Actors
_Uh, if you don't know what actors are, this analogy might not help, but I'm going with it anyway._

Tasks are actors (think [Erlang actors][actors] or [Akka][akka]). The first time you send a 
message to an [actor][actors], a task (an actor) is implicitly created.

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart TD
    client((client))
    client--send msg-->box[implicit mailbox]
    box-->task--"also<br/>queued"-->client
</div>

Messages are processed one-at-a-time, in the order they were received. Messages can 
mutate task state. But it doesn't get crazy because the interaction is very **single 
threaded** (well, I guess you could process messages in parallel, but why?)


## UIs are Agents
I think of a UI as being an agent that happens to have a **human behind it**. Not an AI agent,
but a human agent. The UI application code handles the computer part, the human handles
the intelligence part.

Yes, A2A was designed for sending messages between AI agents, but we don't currently live
in a world where open-ended multi-agent systems are pervasive. We do live in a world
where **humans talk** to agents. And that won't ever really change, because 
agents aren't super valuable if their work never makes it to a human.

## A2A supports any data
Each message, in either direction, contains multiple parts, each of one of these types:

- **TextPart** — plain text, think unprocessed LLM outputs
- **DataPart** — think JSON or binary. The format is specified by the [mime type][type]
- **FilePart** — like DataPart, but can be at a URL

So an agent can do things like mix plain LLM outputs with JSON outputs.


## Delegate state to Prefect or Temporal
One subtly difficult part of A2A is that it requires keeping **state**, potentially over long
periods of time.

For example, an agent realizes the initiating user didn't say enough, so it
asks for clarification. People aren't very good computers and while we sometimes 
respond quickly, sometimes we take minutes or hours, or **even years**. Or never. 

How do you deal with that?

I've dealt with this by using systems like [Temporal][temp] and [Prefect][pre].
Both are sometimes called "workflow" systems, but can also be thought of as providing
**durable function** execution. 

Both are more interesting than most workflow systems because they also provide **suspend &
resume** functionality. For example, in prefect [you can call][sus] `await suspend_flow_run()`
and the flow will be completely shut down and occupy zero memory or CPU while the user
is twiddling their thumbs.

### The Shim
I pulled this diagram directly from [FastA2A][fasta2a] docs:

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart TB
    Server["HTTP Server"] <--> |Sends Requests/<br>Receives Results| TM

    subgraph CC[Core Components]
        direction RL
        TM["TaskManager<br>(coordinates)"] --> |Schedules Tasks| Broker
        TM <--> Storage
        Broker["Broker<br>(queues & schedules)"] <--> Storage["Storage<br>(persistence)"]
        Broker --> |Delegates Execution| Worker
    end

    Worker["Worker<br>(implementation)"]
</div>

_Note: I like FastA2A because it implements the HTTP endpoints as a [Starlette][star] app that you
can easily mount right into your API alongside everything else. Also, it has basically
nothing to do with [Pydantic][pydantic] or [Pydantic AI][pydantic-ai] other than it happens
to be collocated inside the same Github repository._

FastA2A clearly realizes there's a state problem and so they created **interfaces** for
dealing with it. Not only that, but these interfaces are a fairly standard architecture
for workflow systems.

I've created simple shims for both Temporal and Prefect that use the workflow systems to
**implement** the TaskManager, Storage and Broker. The idea being you could use either 
Prefect or Temporal, whichever you prefer, to quickly create a robust A2A-compatible agent.

They're each ~100 lines of code, yet 
implement just about everything you'd want from a stateful system, from retries and
deployments to observability and a management UI.

Where does this fit into your agent?

Say you're following the [Plan-Act-Verify][pav] flow that's become popular:

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart TD
    client((client))
    client-->clarify[Clarify Question]-->Plan-->Act["Act (Query)"]-->Verify-->Plan
    Verify-->prepare[Prepare Report]-->client2((client))
</div>

All those boxes are things that need to happen once and only once (well, in a loop). Every agent
has a slightly different take on this, but many boil down to some variant of this architecture. 
The workflows don't have to be complicated (but by all means, they can be).

The point is, yes, A2A is stateful and statefulness can be hard. But it can be solved simply
and cleanly by delegating to other hardened distributed systems that were designed to
do this well.

## A2A Versus MCP
Simply, MCP is for tools (function-like things with inputs and outputs). A2A is for when
you need **free-form** communication. Hence why tasks look more like actors.

They also solve similar **fan-out problems**. MCP enables many tools to be used by few AI
applications or agents. A2A enables many agents to be used by few user interfaces and other agents.

<div class="mermaid">
flowchart TD
    subgraph c[A2A Clients]
      teams[MS Teams]
      agentspace[Google <br/>AgentSpace]
      ServiceNow
    end
    subgraph m[MCP Servers]
        comp[Computer <br/>Use]
        search[Web <br/>Search]
        APIs
    end
    teams-->Agent[A2A-compatible<br/>Agent]
    agentspace-->Agent
    ServiceNow-->Agent
    Agent-->comp
    Agent-->search
    Agent-->APIs
</div>

_Side note: [AI Engineering][aieng] has become incredibly complex. You have to master not just AI tech, but 
also be a full-stack engineer and a data engineer. The emergence of A2A & MCP dramatically reduces
the scope of an AI engineer, and that's exciting on it's own._

# Implementation is picking up quickly
I'm going to **finish this post** by linking to a ton of products that are using A2A or soon will. My 
hope being that you'll realize that now is a good time to get in on this.
