<div class='post'>
Just to be clear, I have had Linux on my main home computer for several years. In fact, I'm writing this on Linux and I'm not having any problems. I have no intention of giving up Linux. I like how it works and I like tinkering with the different parts of it. <br /><br />I use Ubuntu. Ubuntu really is Linux for humans - its easy to use and everything just works. Well...almost everything. I installed the 64-bit version and Adobe didn't support 64-bit flash for a long time (and I couldn't install 32-bit Firefox). Seriously, how many web sites use flash? Essentially every site that my wife and I both use. My wife hates Linux. <br /><br />There's two sides to the Linux community. There are the people who want to see Linux for the masses (Canonical &amp; team) and then there's the hardcore users.<br /><br />The thing that really gets me about Linux is that the hardcore  users have no intention of making Linux easier to use.   I usually don't have a problem finding Linux help on the Internet, but the gurus that answer Linux questions aren't particularly easy going. I've spent enough time reading through forums for Linux help that I know that they follow a strict rubric:<br /><ol><li>Always use command line. The biggest thing is installing new programs and packages. They could easily tell someone that they need to install package <i>x</i>, but instead they always use the command line:<br /><pre class="brush: shell">sudo apt-get install destroy_linux<br /></pre>Seriously, why can't you just use the pretty UI that Ubuntu&nbsp; created for installing software? I know they are easy commands, but seriously. Not making things easy for my wife.</li><li>Always make things more complicated than necessary. Usually this involves using the command line with three times as many commands than you really need. But also chastising for silly questions</li><li>Keep things magical. Magical lands are fun at Disney land, but I hate punching in inexplicably terse text into a console. The terms and commands become shorter and less descriptive as you get deeper into Linux (there is no end). Don't try to understand.</li></ol>There has always been this expectation that eventually everyone will cling to Linux and reject Windows. I think that day won't come until most of the Linux kernal development team &amp; posse have died/started using Windows. The problem with Linux is, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, it's users. <br /><ol></ol></div>
