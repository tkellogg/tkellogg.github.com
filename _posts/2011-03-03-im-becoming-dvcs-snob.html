<div class='post'>
Today i was looking at open source workflow frameworks for work today and paused on <a href="http://objectflow.codeplex.com/">objectflow</a>. I almost decided not to use the library because they're still using SVN or TFS (I'm not real sure which) even though codeplex supports <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mecurial</a>.<br /><br />I'm coming in with the idea that I may contribute to the project if I find, down the road, that I have something that could be added to the project. Submitting patches seems so painful compared to a simple pull request. The workflow of a distributed version control system (DVCS) makes sharing code so incredibly easy that it causes me psychological pain to think about going back to SVN.<br /><br />On the other hand, one benefit of objectflow being available as SVN is that I can easily use git-svn to create a git clone that can be included as a submodule. It wouldn't be quite as straight-forward if it were a mecurial repository. Submodules are an excellent feature of Git!</div>
