I found <a href="https://github.com/blog/771-mind-control-with-frickin-lasers">this blog post</a>&nbsp;about a couple Harvard students who wrote some [GPL'd] software for controlling worms' minds. They can control how these worms move and even make them lay eggs!<br /><br />The implications of this are obviously huge. This is only an academic project now, but in a couple decades I wonder if we'll see animals used like machines? I guess there's several other ideas you could draw from this, but no matter how you view it, it's a fascinating idea.</div>
