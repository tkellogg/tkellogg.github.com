<div class='post'>
I've always used NUnit for testing code so it's naturally the framework I'm most familiar with (I haven't used anything else). I learned unit testing using the classic <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual)</span> methods. Although, I was finding my tests slightly confusing to read - I sometimes can't remember which comes first, expected or actual.<br /><br />More recently I've been getting into v2.5 including the new asserts - <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Assert.That(actual, Is.EqualTo(expected))</span>. I think this makes a lot of sense and I often find myself using <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Assert.That</span> most of the time just because it makes sense.<br /><br />Recently, a coworker created a few extension methods that I'm finding quite handy:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: c#">public static void ShouldBe(this object @this, object expected) {<br />    Assert.AreEqual((dynamic)expected, (dynamic)@this);<br />}<br />public static void ShouldNotBe(this object @this, object expected) {<br />    Assert.AreNotEqual((dynamic)expected, (dynamic)@this);<br />}<br />public static void ShouldBeNull(this object @this) {<br />    Assert.IsNull(@this);<br />}<br />public static void ShouldNotBeNull(this object @this) {<br />    Assert.IsNotNull(@this);<br />}</pre><br />I've completely fallen in love with how this reads: <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">actual.ShouldBe(expected)</span>. It also makes me giggle to do <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">actual.ShouldBeNull()</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"> (Don't you love extension methods?)</span>. This makes unit testing so easy...</div>
