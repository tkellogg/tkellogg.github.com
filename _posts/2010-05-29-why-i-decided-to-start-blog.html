<span style="font-size: large;"><b></b></span><br />I strongly believe that for every avenue of life that we enter, we should leave it a better place. So for every job that I take, my goal is to leave  a more efficient or more powerful work group behind. By blogging I can bring up issues that I come across, and if I also bring up solutions to those problems I can give other people the chance to learn from my experiences.<br /><br />I also believe strongly in open source software (OSS). I wish there were more companies like <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google</a> that invest a lot of capital in developing OSS. From a business standpoint, when considering investment in public resources like OSS, it is hard to see the ROI. I think Google has done an exceptional job of finding revenue from OSS, and I think that is  positive for the world.<br /><br />Blogging is similar to OSS in the way that blogs are a public resource and they're written by regular people in their spare time (I wish I could be paid to develop OSS). I read a lot of blogs from other technical people. Some of them I <a href="http://www.nullorempty.com/">follow regularly</a>, others I end up inadvertently reading by googling for <a href="http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/39678.html">some technical problem</a>. Blogs are free content that adds value to our lives. <br /><br />Starting a blog was a result of a lot of  thinking. It's been bugging me for a while that I read all these blogs and I don't write one. I think its important to give back at least a portion of what you consume. If you don't like what I have to say here you don't have to read it. What I say here won't waste anyone's time or clog their inbox without their consent. Since this blog can't ever be a burden on society, it can only add value. So in that line of logic, this blog is necessary.</div>
