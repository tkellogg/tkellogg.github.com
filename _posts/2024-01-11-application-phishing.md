"Prompt injection" is a perilously misleading term, we need a better phrase for it that helps beginners intuitively
understand what's going on. 

Don't believe me? imagine if, instead of "phishing" we called it "email injection". I mean, technically the attacker
is injecting words into an email, but no, that's dumb. The attacker is convincing the LLM to perform nefarious 
behavior using language that's indistinguishable from valid input.

Everyone I've ever talked to about it has immediately drawn a parallel between "prompt injection" and "SQL injection". 
The way to guard agaist SQL injection is validation & sanitation. But there is no "prepared statement API" for LLMs.
There can't be, it doesn't fit the problem. Experienced people figure this out, but less experienced people often don't,
and I'm worried that's leading to innappropriate security measures.

Nathan Hamiel ([fediverse link][fedi]) wrote about this back in October, in a post titled, ["Prompt Injection is 
Social Engineering Applied to Applications"][blog]. His post is well constructed, but I think the title is too wordy
to be helpful to software engineers. 

I propose a new term: **Application Phishing** — the application itself is the target of a phishing attack.

It might feel a little strange at first, that an application can be the target of a phishing attack. But thinking about
it that way is probably the most fruitful, as it highlights the true challenges of the problem.

Nathan says:

> from a security perspective, I’ve described LLMs as having a single interface with an unlimited number of undocumented protocols. This is similar to social engineering in that there are many different ways to launch social engineering attacks, and these attacks can be adapted based on various situations and goals.

What's this mean? Well, with SQL there's a [well-defined grammar][grammar]. In other words, when the SQL interpreter
sees input like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM
```

It knows what the next chunk of text can and can't be. It can't be a `.`, but it could be `alpha.users`. So, with a
prepared statement,

```sql
SELECT * FROM alpha.users WHERE name = ?
```

It's able to parse the user input and substitute the `?` for a valid SQL string literal. So if an attacker sent:

```sql
' OR name = 'Jeff Bezos
```

The prepared statement would end up preparing a SQL statement that looks like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM alpha.users WHERE name = '\' OR name = \'Jeff Bezos'
```

Which wouldn't match anything, whereas without a prepared statement it would look like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM alpha.users WHERE name = '' OR name = 'Jeff Bezos'
```

Which would allow the attacker to view information for a user that they don't have access to.

_There is nothing like prepared statements for LLMs_ because that would ruin the **entire point of LLMs**. We like
LLMs because you can throw just about any text at them and they somehow make sense of it and give reasonably-sounding
responses. It feels like magic. 

If you can successfully deploy input validation for an LLM application, you probably **shouldn't be using an LLM**.
If your input is that strict, you can probably get away with something much cheaper and more accurate.


# What to do instead?

Design. Design. Design.

If truly you need the LLMs unconstrained input, then you need to start thinking about the LLM as if it were an employee
that's susceptible to phishing attacks. 


## 1. Reduce Privilidge

The [principle of least priviledge][plp] is very powerful here. Give the LLM
as little access to data as possible. If it can perform actions, reduce what it's allowed to do by closing down ports
and reducing filesystem access. Run actions in a VM ([not a Docker container][docker]).


## 2. Reduce User Base

If you can't reduce it's access to data or actions, then reduce who can use it. If only you can use it, that reduces
risk significantly.


# Refrain-Restrict-Trap

Nathan wrote [another article about mitigating][rrt] that breaks it down into 3 steps:

![A flowchart with three nodes connected by arrows. The top node is labeled 'Refrain' in a blue rectangle. Arrows point from 'Refrain' to the other two nodes. To the bottom left is a node labeled 'Trap' in an orange rectangle, and to the bottom right, a node labeled 'Restrict' in a green rectangle. An arrow points from 'Restrict' back to 'Trap', completing the cycle.](https://cybermashup.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/pi_mitigation_steps.png)

1. _**Refrain**_: Do you really need an LLM? If you can avoid an LLM, that erases a large attach surface from your threat model.
2. _**Restrict**_: Reduce the LLMs access to data & user base, as I've described above.
3. _**Trap**_: Your traditional input & output validation.

Nathan's _Trap_ point doesn't sit well with me for the same reasons I want to move away from "Prompt Injection" as a 
term. The input is too unconstrained, and constraining it often inhibits the behavior that makes LLMs interesting to 
begin with.

More than anything, focus hard on restricting the potential damage an attacker can do through an LLM. That's
the only truly fool proof mitigation. That might reduce what you can do with an LLM, but it's worth it if 
you want to keep your users safe.



# ADDENDUM: For Researchers
If you're a researcher, read this idea here and see if there's something workable.

The thorny problem here is that the system prompt is accepted through the same channel as the user's questions and data.
If you can untangle these into different channels, the problem might become solveable, and there might be additional benefits.


<div class="mermaid">
graph TD
  sys[system prompt]
  user[user data]
  sys-->model
  user-->model-->output
</div>

I think the core of the problem might be _task recognition_. If you disable the possibility of the model recognizing a task
within user's portion of the prompt, then you've effectively implemented the same construct as prepared statements.
I imagine, this would look a bit like there being multiple models at work:

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD
  sys[system prompt]-->cp[control plane<br/> model]
  user[user data]-->dp[data plane<br/> model]
  cp-->dp-->output
</div>

My understanding is that task recognition takes place within the attention layers which are notoriously compute-intensive. 
So a data plane model with reduced or eliminated capabilities for task recognition might be able to skip parts of the attention layers.
A full trip through both control and data plane models might be slow, maybe even slower, a trip through just the
data plane might be very fast and suitable for building applications on.

I don't have the skills to build such a model, but I hope by talking about it, an idea might be sparked that leads to
addressing application phishing in a meaningful way while also maintaing the LLM's primary capabilities.
