When will OpenAI change their models to inject ads? I've heard this question several times
and, frankly, I think the answer is somewhere between "they won't" and "they won't any time soon"
because it doesn't align to their current GTM strategy.

I don't know any of their strategies, I don't work for them, but let's make some observations:

1. [Massive initial growth][growth] in the ChatGPT app
2. OpenAI asked Microsoft for [$7 **trillion** dollars][trillion], to fund new models. It did not happen.
3. Models released since GPT-4 are progressively smaller and cheaper, and marginally more capable
4. They just made [GPT-4o free][free] in ChatGPT
5. ChatGPT Enterprise is **PRICEY** (typically anywhere from [$100k to $15M annually][pricey])
6. OpenAI has [two personalities][two]: (1) a well-meaning non-profit pursuing AGI, and (2) a profit-hungry VC-fueled startup.

The question, "will they serve ads", hinges on who the target customer is. If it's consumers, then they would
be doubling down on paid ChatGPT subscriptions. However — point #4 — they just made their best model free.

Their customer is enterprises! OpenAI is a VC-fueled startup, startups will focus their entire being 
into serving their customer. Everything they do is to serve that customer better.

Lower prices are a top request by companies. Consumers don't care, they just want a stable monthly price.
OpenAI has put a massive amount of resources into moving from GPT-4 to GPT-4-turbo to GPT-4o to GPT-4o-mini.
Each of those models is smaller and cheaper than the last, which is what enterprises want.

A perfect next play might be to ship an on-premise air-gapped appliance to run ChatGPT in a way that
customers can be absolutely certain of their privacy.

## Ads Risk All That
Ads aren't good revenue models for targeting enterprises. It telegraphs a lack of privacy, 
which is a core concern for enterprises. Injecting ads into **any** of their apps or models would
risk trust with enterprise customers, their main source of revenue.

## The Non-Profit Alter Ego
We like to forget this, but the parent company is still a non-profit with the goal of achieving AGI.
While Sam Altman certainly pushes hard in the profitable startup direction, they still have a
governing body that wants to see more potent models. In fact, they've [begun training GPT-5][5]. 
They've been clear that a GPT-5 would be strictly a smarter and more capable model.

Ads risk this as well. It takes R&D effort away from AGI, it risks the revenue stream, and it also
risks the data stream.

## Ads Aren't Happening
OpenAI is clearly using consumer ChatGPT in two ways:

1. As an advertisement for the Enterprise version
2. As a data collection mechanism — to achieve their dreams of a GPT-5, GPT-6, etc.

Not only would adding ads be a departure from that strategy, it would risk their primary revenue
stream in an irreconcilable way.
