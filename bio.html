<ul>
<li><a href='http://timkellogg.blogspot.com'>Blogger</a> - the original source of my blog. The blog content that appears on this site is pulled via the <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/'>gdata api</a></li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/tkellogg'>Github</a> - where I participate in open source software development and architecture. If there were one link that I think best represents me, this would be it.</li>

<li><a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/503826/kelloti'>Stack Overflow</a> - There was a time were I was active. Since then I decided it was more useful to develop open source software than to just talk about it</li>

<li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/timothy.kellogg'>Facebook</a> - I find it harder and harder to keep up with facebook. But alas, I do occasionally post.</li>

<li><a href='http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-kellogg/13/29/698'>LinkedIn</a> - Probably last on my list of social networking interests. Just too impractical to keep up to date with.</li>
